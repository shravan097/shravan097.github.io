I am a beginner roller skater so I expected myself to fall here and there but I did not expect my watch to break when I fell. Luckily, the watch is repairable. Until the watch is repaired, I am living without a watch on my hand and I have no idea how to keep track of the time. This made me remember how people in past reminded themselves of time. It was the church bell every hour. So I wanted to hack my Google Home to do the same.\n\n\n## Hacking Google Home\nI was expecting Google Home to provide an SDK or an API to just send a notification but that seemed difficult. Google Home SDK allows devices to notify in the event of someone ringing a doorbell or object detected via a security camera and many more. But to send a notification, you must be a \"device\". I spent about 1 hour on how to make this work and I did not like this approach. I had to make and register a fake device that would send notifications hourly to google home. Registering a device was a pain so I looked for alternatives and I found one.\n\n## Casting to Google Home\nAfter looking at numerous Github projects, I found this project called, [go-chromecast](https://github.com/vishen/go-chromecast) that would enable anyone to cast an audio file to the google home within the same network with a simple CLI. This method was very doable and here are the steps:\n\n- Setup Raspberry Pi with wifi.\n- Install Go and go-Chromecast CLI in the Raspberry Pi.\n- Setup a shell script that pulls in the church bell mp4 file via a public dropbox URL. \n- Create a CRON Job to run this command every hour from 6 AM - 11 AM.\n\nAnd that was all I had to do to make my google home ring church sound every hour. \n\nThis simple IoT project was very fun and hands-on so this would be a good project for anyone who wants to understand how to apply code in real life. \n\n\n#### Future Blogs Topic Idea\n- State Machines & Workflow Engines\n","frontmatter":{"date":"September 16, 2022","slug":"/blog/google-home-church-bell","title":"Make Google Home Ring Church Bells Every Hour","tags":["IoT","Google Home"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4c6bc5b2-4a71-557c-a35c-4bf2060789f4","frontmatter__slug":"/blog/google-home-church-bell","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"blog"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1877707664"]}
