## WIP - Will update this soon 
## Background

In 2016, I purchased `shravandhakal.com` from GoDaddy and I was ready to build my personal website for the first time. At that time, I was unfamiliar with website design. I was a first year undergrad finishing only `CS-103: Intro To Programming In C++`. I don't think I have ever met anyone who said that *"I am able to build a website after learning C++"*. I do acknowledge that it is possible with pain. Nevertheless, I wanted to build something for my domain. So I started out with simple static site with a single file,`index.html`, containing everything.
