## Background
I remember my first site. I had just finished my first ever coding class, `CS-103: Intro To Programming In C++`. After learning C++, I figured building website is an easy task. No, its not. Building an website is a lot of effort. You need design mocks. Then you will need to write CSS. You will need HTML. You will need Javascript. You will need domain. You will need server. It is a lot of work. As a first step, I ended up writing a simple static website all in single `index.html` file. I purchased `shravandhakal.com` from GoDaddy. I chose  a free static hosting server. My site was live in 2016. It looked something like the following picture:

As time progressed, I discovered more about web development. I learned about these bootstrap CSS that lets you make incredible design with minimal effort. I stumbled upon, [w3schools](https://w3schools.com/). I figured I would apply these bootstrap CSS in my personal site. In 2018, I updated my site to look this:

The new site was fantastic. It had cool animation. It was responsive. It was all I could ask for. I ended up adding a 1 year later using Jekyll. This was working very well but it had one big flaw. Updating this site with new information like, adding a new experience, was difficult. There was code duplication all over the place. Reading HTML file to make a simple update was not fun. In 2022, I decided I needed to revisit & redesign my website. Here is how my website looks like right now:
